University Admit Eligibility Predictor

During the admission season, everyone is in a state of dilemma of choosing the university and whether they are eligible for the university.

To make the work easy, we deployed a project on predicting eligibility called the university admit eligibility predictor. 

This app deployed using the basics of Machine Learning. It is an open web application that allows user to check their eligibility.

The first module consists of a form that gets the detail of the user's GRE, TOEFL, the total number of Statement of Purpose (SOP) the user has, the total number of Letters of Recommendation (LOR) 
the user has, Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), and if the user has any research done.

The user has to select the university from 1 to 5. 

If the user is eligible, the user is redirected to a page with their predicted score printed. If the user is not eligible, the user is redirected to a page with their predicted score printed.
